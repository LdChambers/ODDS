Questions of the project pitch:
Q1: What is something that groups in the past did well and on the flipside what are some areas that you saw could use improvement?
-	They came up with a good way to store data
-	Eric wasn’t as prepared as he is this time around (a good definition of what needed to be done)
-	Getting the tools and other resources to fully take on the project
-	clear vision of the full timeline of the project

Q2: Can you quantify or explain the impact of the problem you are facing?
-	no math done yet on amount of time saved
-	currently they charge $5 for every student and Eric & Co do all the work
-	future they will charge $10 and use the app
-	so double the charge and none of the work (since the app will do it all)

Q3: Can you quantify or explain the benefit that this solution would provide (time/money saved)?
-	Saves Eric and Co a lot of time 
-	automated certificates, class lists, pulling up records, …etc
-	putting the workload onto the customers

Q4: Are there any stakeholders for this project beyond your company and the micro-entrepreneur class instructors?
-	All the instructors and schools they are partnered with in Texas

Q5: Could you explain the process you are trying to automate step-by-step? (How are you currently running these classes?)
-	How are the certifications currently filled out and distributed?
-	generate the cert (issuing a number), take the data every so often and export a spreadsheet (CSV) and upload that to the state
-	How does the payment process currently work?
-	Students pay 20-30ish bucks for a class, Eric & Co currently take $5 per student for the process of dealing with certificates and student management (instructor gets a base rate as well)
-	How is reporting to the state done currently?
-	through a CSV spreadsheet that gets uploaded to the state with students records

Q6: What do you like about the current process that you wish to keep?
-	still generating certificates 
-	maybe change to a QR code for students to input their own information

Q7: Is there a reason and method for us to contact the end-users of this product?
-	Only if app has difficulties after launch
-	Contact Eric for this if needed

Q8: Are there any related systems that this project will need to interact with?
-	digital ocean (same premise as AWS)
-	3 docker servers
-	2 dedicated databases
-	seat panel / control web panel
-	3 cloud panels
-	PBX server
-	virtual disk (NAS)
-	monthly bill for Eric = $630
-	no dedicated testing environment

Q9: Brooks advice for our group
-	We need defined roles so we can tackle each part of the app without butting heads
-	Keep up on documentation so we don’t fall behind

Initial ideas:





Constrains:




Open questions:
●	Could you provide us with an ER Diagram of the database for a higher level view?
○	table names are always lowercase, no spaces, plural, no special characters
○	field names no dashes underscores, except FKs (FK-name)
○	id’s for specific tables is the tablenameID
○	gui IDs, password encryption generation can be problematic

-	Start with the classroom management portion, and other links to students/classrooms…etc
-	SMTO to go
