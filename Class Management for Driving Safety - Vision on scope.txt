Vision
1.	Introduction
1.1	Background
Online Defensive Driving Schools LLC (ODDS) currently relies on a manual and time-intensive process to manage student records, generate course completion certificates, and facilitate payments for its classroom providers. Currently, certificates are created manually by the ODDS team, with data periodically exported into spreadsheets and uploaded to the state for reporting purposes. The payment process is also fragmented. Students pay course fees directly to the classroom provider, and ODDS  charges classroom providers a cost per student to manage certification and record-keeping (currently $5 per student). While this approach has allowed the business to operate, it requires significant ongoing effort from the client and introduces inefficiencies for both instructors and students.

Over time, these inefficiencies have created several challenges. The manual generation of certificates delays delivery to students, often causing frustration. Classroom providers often lack centralized access to student and class data, making organization and coordination more challenging. Additionally, the lack of an integrated payment system places a burden on both the company and instructors. As ODDS continues to partner with multiple instructors and schools across Texas, these problems become increasingly complex and costly.

The client is seeking a comprehensive solution that automates certification, centralizes class and student data, and simplifies payment processes. This decision is motivated not only by the desire to reduce time and labor but also by the opportunity to enhance the experience for both classroom providers and students.

2.	Business Requirements
2.1	Business Opportunity/Problem Statement
The problem of manual certificate generation and lack of centralized classroom management affects ODDS, the Classroom Providers working with them, and the students of these classes. One impact of this problem is requiring a large and unnecessary time investment for the client company in generating certificates and retrieving data. Another is a lack of direction in class organization, centralization of class payment processes, and access to data for Classroom Providers. Finally, there is a delay in the time it takes for students to get their certificates after they complete a course. A successful solution would automate the certificate generation process by allowing students/providers to enter information and providers to convert said information into a certification pdf. It would also centralize all of the class, student, and instructor data allowing for easy retrieval for both the client company and classroom providers. Furthermore, it would allow students to receive their certification through email or print on the same day they complete the course. Lastly, it would provide a centralized system for receiving payment from students through a centralized system and providing payment to ODDS.

2.2	Business Objectives
BO-1: Automate all of the work required by the client for issuing certificates (Manually converting the forms to PDF)

BO-2: Increase the revenue obtained through certificate generation from $5 per student to $10 per student 

BO-3: Increase efficiency and ease of retrieving class, student, and instructor data by 50%

2.3	Success Metrics
SM-1: 100% of certificates will be issued automatically within one business day of course completion

SM-2:  50% reduction in staff time spent on certificate processing and data entry compared to current baseline

SM-3:  Increase in revenue from $5 to $10 per student with full instructor adoption of the system

2.4	Vision Statement
For classroom providers and instructors teaching driving safety courses in Texas who need an easy way to manage classes, process students, and issue certificates without delays. The Class Management for Driving Safety system is a web-based and mobile-friendly classroom management platform that lets instructors create classes, enter student details, process certificates, and handle payments in one place with real-time certificate issuance and reporting. Unlike the current manual, spreadsheet-based, and fragmented process, our product automates certificate generation, centralizes class/student/instructor data, simplifies payments, and enhances both provider and student experience.

State Agencies (TDLR)	Accurate and timely reporting	Neutral towards the solution, the data they receive in the reports will be the same regardless	Reliable data export	Compliance requirements	No

3.2	User Environment
The primary users in this system are driving safety instructors in Texas. A typical class cycle is a single-day session that lasts several hours and concludes with a meal. In the current model, instructors send student information to the provider, who then processes certificates and driving records—often leading to delays, especially when classes are held on weekends.
With the new system, instructors will manage the entire workflow themselves: entering student data, retrieving driving records, and issuing certificates directly. This shift significantly reduces provider workload while giving instructors greater autonomy and control. The number of people involved in each cycle decreases since provider staff no longer need to manually process submissions. The system must be accessible on mobile and desktop platforms, as instructors often work in transient or non-office environments. Integration with TDLR’s approved certificate management processes is essential, and the solution should be compatible with common tools like email and secure online portals to distribute certificates efficiently.
3.3	Alternatives and Competition
Currently, instructors have a few alternatives when it comes to offering driving safety classes. The first is maintaining the status quo, where they send student information to the provider, who then handles certificates and driving records. While this ensures compliance and takes the administrative burden off the instructors, it often leads to delays in certificate delivery, especially for weekend classes, and creates a heavy workload for the provider. Another option is turning to other licensed providers who may offer different fee structures or slightly faster processing. However, these alternatives usually give instructors less flexibility and still tie them to the provider’s processing timelines. Finally, instructors could attempt to create their own homegrown solutions, but these are not viable since TDLR regulations require certificates to come from licensed providers, making such efforts noncompliant and legally invalid. Compared to these alternatives, the new system stands out by giving instructors direct control to manage records and issue certificates immediately, while also reducing provider workload and increasing revenue per student.
